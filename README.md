# TriviaGame

Created a trivia game that provides 10 questions about animals for the user to guess. If the user clicks the submit button or if the timer runs out of time the quiz ends and it displays how many questsions the user got correct and incorrect. 

When the timer runs out of time the program does not currently work as intended.
